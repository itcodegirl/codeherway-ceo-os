All notable updates are documented here for portfolio and release-review context.

## 2026-05-12 - Product-readiness follow-ups (round 2)

Additional commits on `improve/ceo-os-product-readiness` covering the
"deferred follow-up work" the first round listed in its PR description.
All five follow-ups are now in the branch.

Trust — feedback the founder can rely on:

- **Kind-tagged Chief feedback.** The Chief workspace used to store
  `feedback` as a bare string and protect the high-value "Created: …" /
  "AI unavailable: …" / "Unable to generate" messages by regex-matching
  the prefix in the autosave timer. Brittle: any reword silently broke
  the guard, and the regex did not cover the "Add all complete" or
  per-item acceptance results. A small `chiefFeedback` module introduces
  an `info / progress / result / error` taxonomy; the hook stores a
  `{ kind, text }` internally, still exposes the bare text on `feedback`
  (no public-API churn), and the autosave timer skips its info-level
  "Notes saved" message whenever the current kind is `result` or
  `error`. Regression test forces a generation failure and asserts the
  error message survives the 2.5s autosave threshold.

UX clarity — explain what each click will do:

- **Quiet output loading state.** The "Reading your notes / Pulling out
  priorities / Mapping opportunities / Drafting content ideas" step
  list read as AI theater (the proxy does not run those stages) and
  turned the wait into performance art. Replaced with a calm skeleton
  that mirrors the real summary + section card structure, plus a single
  sr-only role=status announcement and a `prefers-reduced-motion`
  override that drops the shimmer animation.
- **Per-item acceptance previews.** The "Add All" button has explained
  its effect for a while via `buildAcceptanceSummary`; the four per-item
  accept buttons did not. Added a shared `acceptancePreview` helper that
  emits a short caption ("Weekly Brief · priority", "Opportunities ·
  stage Discovery", "Content OS · LinkedIn", "Weekly Brief · task") and
  a long aria-label / title sentence ("Add priority 'Ship pricing v2'
  to this week's Weekly Brief") for every section. The visible button
  text is unchanged so the layout stays calm; the new information is
  opt-in via hover or screen reader.

Usefulness — stop hiding work the user has already done:

- **Recent outputs strip.** `chiefRepository` already kept the last 30
  responses in storage; the UI only rendered `responses[0]`. Now a
  horizontal "Recent outputs" strip renders one chip per response with
  the position ("Latest" / "1 back" / "2 back" …) and the source ("AI
  generated" / "Local fallback"). Clicking a chip swaps the active
  output panel; a new generation auto-pulls the selection forward. The
  strip self-hides for 0 or 1 responses to keep the panel calm on the
  first run.

Reliability — persistence aligned with the rest of the app:

- **Chief workspace on the versioned-envelope pattern.**
  `chiefRepository` was the only domain writing raw localStorage keys
  outside the schema registry — `ceo-os-chief-notes` as a bare string,
  `ceo-os-chief-responses` as a bare JSON array. Both now use
  `writeVersionedLocalStorage` / `readVersionedLocalStorage` so a future
  schema bump can land via the central migration registry instead of a
  point fix. Legacy bare-string chief notes are read correctly (without
  triggering the storage-corruption preservation banner) and upgraded
  to an envelope on the next save.

Checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and
`vitest run` (697 passing, 1 skipped — was 678/1 before this round)
all green.

## 2026-05-12 - Product-readiness pass

Branch `improve/ceo-os-product-readiness`.

Reliability — green baseline restored:

- `src/hooks/useChiefOfStaff.js` and `src/pages/ChiefOfStaff.test.jsx`
  carried unresolved merge fragments that broke `npm run build`,
  `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` on `main`: a dangling `? :`
  pair after a completed `return` in `getDefaultFeedback()`, and a
  split-apart empty-state assertion that referenced a non-existent
  "Ready to generate" string. Both are repaired; build, lint, typecheck,
  and the Vitest suite are green again.

Bug fixes:

- **Weekly Brief now actually renders the "Founder brief" summary.**
  `WeeklyBriefSummary` was imported into `src/pages/WeeklyBrief.jsx` but
  never placed in the JSX, so the at-a-glance focus/priorities/wins/
  blockers readout with the one-click "Copy brief" — advertised in the
  README and this changelog — didn't exist for users. It renders between
  the intent line and the editor grid, wired to the live lists and the
  in-progress reflection draft.

Trust:

- **Chief of Staff "Reset Workspace" now asks for confirmation.** It used
  to wipe the founder's notes and saved action plans with one click and
  no undo, right next to the action chips. It now opens a `ConfirmModal`
  ("Reset Chief workspace? … It can't be undone." / Keep workspace /
  Reset workspace) and only clears on confirm.

UX clarity:

- The Chief of Staff notes autosave confirmation no longer says
  "Draft pipeline ready" (there is no pipeline) and no longer overwrites
  a "Created: …" or error message 2.5s after a keystroke — it now shows
  a plain "Notes saved. Pick an action when you are ready." and yields to
  result/error messages the user still needs to read.
- Focus Home no longer renders the full-width **System Pulse** strip — it
  duplicated the "next move" + open-loops signal already shown by the
  page's own panels (calmer top fold on the thesis page). System Pulse
  still renders on the other product surfaces where it's the only
  cross-system signal.

Accessibility:

- **Modal focus restoration no longer strands focus on `<body>`.** If the
  element that opened a dialog has unmounted by the time the dialog
  closes (e.g. a table-row action button whose row re-rendered), focus
  now falls back to the `#main-content` landmark instead of a detached
  node. The pending initial-focus animation frame is also cancelled on
  unmount. Covered by a new regression test.

Hygiene:

- Stripped stray UTF-8 BOMs from ten `chief/*` source files.
- Relaxed two markdown-lint style rules in `.markdownlint.json`
  (`MD032` → off, `MD024` → `siblings_only`) and added the missing blank
  lines after a few `CASE_STUDY.md` sub-headings, so the documented
  `markdownlint-cli2` quality gate is actually green.

Content OS rebuild — idea → published lifecycle (companion audit at
[`docs/audits/content-os-audit.md`](./docs/audits/content-os-audit.md)):

- Status lifecycle widened from `Drafting → Editing → Scheduled` to
  `Idea → Drafting → Editing → Ready → Scheduled → Published`.
- New `ContentItem` fields: `contentType`, `purpose`, `scheduledFor`, `notes`;
  `contentPayloadSchema` validates the new picklists + `YYYY-MM-DD` date format
  and exports `CONTENT_STATUSES` / `CONTENT_TYPES`. Additive migration
  `20260512_content_items_lifecycle_fields.sql`; `contentRepository` normalises
  camelCase ↔ snake_case and selects the new columns on every Supabase path.
  Demo data reworked to show every lane of the lifecycle.
- New `ContentBoard`: a stage filter (chips appear only when more than one
  stage has content, and fall back to *All* rather than stranding an empty
  filter) over a lifecycle-ordered table that floats the soonest-dated piece
  first.
- Table gains content-type and publish-date columns; the detail modal renders
  the full record as label/value rows; the form modal gains content type,
  target publish date, purpose, and repurposing notes.
- Four-card pipeline summary (Ideas / In progress / Ready & scheduled with a
  `Next: <date> — <title>` cue / Published); calmer empty state and CTA copy
  ("Capture your first idea", "Add a content idea or draft", "Add to Pipeline").
- New `contentFormatting` helpers (`formatPublishDate`, `contentStatusRank`,
  `findNextScheduledItem`) with unit coverage; `ContentBoard` tests; content
  page/table tests updated. ContentOS route budget bumped 12→14 kB raw /
  4→4.6 kB gzip to match the new surface.
- Mobile: the summary grid steps 4→2→1 columns; the new table cells carry
  `data-label` for the card collapse; the form type+status pair collapses to
  stacked fields.

Checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`,
`npm run check:route-budgets`,
`npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "!node_modules/**"`, and `vitest run`
(693 passing, 1 skipped) all green.

## 2026-05-11 - Audit priority fixes (Phases 1–6)

Companion branch to the product-readiness audit at
[`docs/audits/ceo-os-product-readiness-audit.md`](./docs/audits/ceo-os-product-readiness-audit.md).
Six phased commits on `improve/ceo-os-audit-priority-fixes`.

Trust & reliability (Phase 1):

- `safeLocalStorageSetItem` / `requireLocalStorageSetItem` now emit
  `saveStatusBus` events on every CRUD write, with a `silent: true`
  escape hatch for internal telemetry housekeeping. The `SaveStatusPill`
  reflects user-data writes, not just `usePersistentState` writes.
- `dataSchema.js` declares the two real chief-workspace storage keys
  (`chiefNotes`, `chiefResponses`), removing the snowflake the audit
  flagged.
- `appErrorTelemetry.writeStoredArray` shares one storage write helper
  with the rest of the app instead of swallowing quota errors inline.
- CSP `connect-src` drops the unused `api.openai.com` host — the browser
  never speaks to OpenAI directly.
- Capture / Journal carry explicit "stays on this device, never synced"
  copy so the local-only nature of those surfaces is honest at the point
  of use.

UX clarity (Phase 2):

- Removed the disabled "Weekly Digest" and "Keyboard Shortcuts" toggles
  from Settings. They read as half-finished.
- Removed the "Connect Supabase: setup required" chip from Settings and
  the "Import backup: coming soon" / "Connect Supabase: setup required"
  chips from Focus Home's first-run card.
- Wrapped the 5-step operating ritual list above Focus Home in a
  collapsed `<details>` so the loop label still teaches the rhythm
  without dominating the top fold.
- Defined four previously-undefined design tokens (`--radius-card`,
  `--radius-md`, `--border-strong`, `--surface-muted`) and added a base
  CSS rule for `.stat-card`.

Feature flow (Phase 3):

- Restored the four secondary Chief of Staff action chips —
  Summarize This Week, Draft LinkedIn Post, Convert to Action Items,
  Suggest Next Priorities — alongside the primary Build Action Plan.
  The proxy already supported all five actions via `getAllowedActionKeys`.
- Added an aging hint to Opportunities: any opportunity in stage
  "Awaiting Reply" with `updatedAt` older than 7 days renders a small
  warning badge ("Waiting Nd") with a screen-reader-friendly aria-label.
- New `WeeklyBriefSummary` panel above the Weekly Brief editors derives a
  founder-readable brief from the current priorities, wins, blockers,
  and reflection — with a one-click "Copy brief" that writes a plain-
  text version to the clipboard.

Accessibility & mobile (Phase 4):

- Bumped dark-theme pill backgrounds from 0.20–0.22 to 0.30–0.32 alpha
  and introduced `--pill-*-text` tokens per theme so pill contrast clears
  AA in both themes.
- `Badge` now accepts an optional `ariaLabel` so contextual badges expose
  expanded labels to screen readers.
- Chief of Staff action chips are grouped under `role="group"` with a
  descriptive `aria-label`.

Architecture cleanup (Phase 5):

- Extracted `src/hooks/useSilentRefresh.js` to encapsulate the
  load-coalesce-subscribe pattern (custom events + storage + focus +
  visibilitychange) that four data hooks re-implemented.
- Migrated `useDashboardData` and `useWorkspaceSettings` onto the helper.
  `useWeeklyBrief` and `useFocusHomeSignals` are intentionally kept on
  their existing per-event handlers and tracked as a follow-up.

Documentation (Phase 6):

- Split the env-variable reference out of README into
  [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md). README trimmed from
  619 lines to roughly the product story plus pointers.
- Added an honest screenshot caveat — the PNGs in `docs/assets/`
  predate the audit cycle and do not match the current UI.
- Refreshed `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` with the deferred items.
- Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe the new `useSilentRefresh`
  abstraction.

Verification: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and the affected
vitest suites pass at every phase commit.

## 2026-05-08 - Senior audit pass: calm-OS polish, snooze, page boundaries

Trust & reliability:

- Added `src/lib/storageMigrations.js`: a forward-compat per-domain × `fromVersion` migration registry, wired into `readVersionedLocalStorage` so reads transparently lift legacy/older payloads. Empty today (every domain is at v1) but the pattern is in place for the next schema bump.

UX clarity:

- Replaced the Dashboard's 0–100 momentum percent with a qualitative state pill — `Visible`, `In motion`, `Steady`, `Quiet day`. The numeric score is kept on the data shape for analytics but is no longer surfaced; a numeric score conflicted with the calm-OS thesis.
- Today's Main Focus panel now surfaces a Chief-of-Staff link when `buildMainFocus` reports `isEmpty: true`, so first-time founders discover the AI surface without an onboarding modal.
- `EmptyState` gained an optional `icon` slot rendered inside an accent-tinted bubble; wired into Opportunities, Content, and Capture.

Feature flow:

- Reminders gained a Snooze button that defers the active reminder until tomorrow at 6 AM local. Snoozed items disappear from the active list and are reachable via "Show N snoozed" with a Wake button to pull them back. New repository functions: `snoozeReminderUntil`, `wakeReminder`, `isReminderSnoozed`, `buildTomorrowSnoozeDeadline`. Hook actions: `reminderActions.snooze` / `wake`.

A11y & mobile:

- `(pointer: coarse)` widens reminder action buttons to 44px on touch devices without changing desktop density.
- `index.html` declares `color-scheme: dark light`, per-scheme `theme-color`, and a `<noscript>` fallback. Meta description rewritten to match the calm-OS thesis.
- Removed redundant aria-labels on the new momentum pill and snooze badge in favour of visible text + `sr-only` prefixes.

Architecture cleanup:

- Extracted `TodayFocusPanel`, `OpenLoopsPanel`, and `BlockersPanel` from `Dashboard.jsx` into co-located components in `src/components/dashboard/`. Each gets its own isolation test. Dashboard.jsx 623 → 567 LOC.

Portfolio polish:

- New `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` covers design trade-offs, why JS not TS yet, why pub/sub via DOM events, what's intentionally out of scope.
- `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` updated with this PR's closed items.

Verification: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:run` (647 passed, 1 skipped, +25 new tests), `npm run build`.

## 2026-05-07 - CEO OS audit: Weekly Supabase conflict hardening

- Dashboard route CSS is back under the static budget by removing unused/decorative Focus Home styles instead of bypassing route-budget governance.
- Added a central `dataSchema` registry for local storage domains and domain model shapes.
- Weekly Brief local storage now writes a versioned schema envelope while continuing to read legacy unwrapped stores.
- Weekly Brief Supabase item selectors now carry `updated_at` through list, create, and update flows so cloud-loaded rows keep a positive `updatedAt` value for conflict checks.
- Weekly Brief Supabase item updates now apply the caller's expected timestamp as an `updated_at` equality filter and raise `StaleRecordError` when another session changed the row first.
- Weekly Brief delete flows now thread `expectedUpdatedAt` from `useWeeklyBrief`, reject stale local deletes, and reject timestamped Supabase deletes without emitting fake progress.
- Added focused mocked-Supabase coverage for Weekly Brief timestamp load/create/update/delete behavior while leaving full authenticated staging regression out of scope.

## 2026-05-05 - Audit cycle 2: trust, error surfaces, dead code, mobile, and perf

Stability:
- `useOfflineQueueDrain` now catches storage-layer rejections and surfaces them as a synthetic drain failure rather than letting them escape as unhandled rejections on every reconnect.
- Capture's `sortedNotes` comparator coerces invalid `updatedAt` to 0 instead of producing NaN comparisons.
- Settings guards the saved-at timestamp before calling `toISOString` so a corrupted legacy value cannot crash the page.
- OpsReliability wraps its stat cards and snapshot table in panel-level `ErrorBoundary` blocks so a malformed Supabase row only takes down its panel, not the whole route.

Reliability:
- `useDashboardData` exposes `loadError` so consumers can distinguish "empty workspace" from "fetch failed". The `onLoadError` callback is wrapped so a thrown `showToast` (post-unmount) cannot escape.
- WeeklyBrief and OpsReliability stat cards render `—` instead of `0` when load fails — no more "Active Priorities: 0" next to a "couldn't load" notice.
- `useChiefOfStaff` and `useChiefTelemetryHealth` replace `void refresh()` fire-and-forget calls with `.catch(() => {})` so unexpected rejects cannot escape the hook boundary.

Architecture:
- Deleted `useDashboardInsights` (389-line hook + 228-line test, **617 lines** of dead code with zero importers).
- Consolidated four hand-rolled `useRef(true)` mount/teardown blocks onto the existing `useIsMountedRef` helper across `useDashboardData`, `useChiefOfStaff`, `useSystemPulse`, and `useWeeklyBrief`.

UX & Mobile:
- `.action-button--small` raised from a fixed `2rem` height to `min-height: 2.25rem` so every sticky action, modal close, retry button, and reminder action meets the 36px touch-target floor on phones.
- OpsReliability snapshot table now collapses on phones via the `data-label` stacked-card pattern already used by `.crm-table` — no more horizontal scroll.
- Settings replaces its sr-only loading announcement with a visible `Loading settings...` helper text + `aria-busy` on the form so sighted users see the page is still hydrating.

Performance:
- `useFocusHomeSignals` gates `setCaptureNotes` / `setJournalEntry` / `setReminders` on shallow equality. Without these guards every focus, visibility, and storage event swapped to a fresh reference and invalidated Dashboard's `nextMoveQueue` / `suggestions` / `mainFocus` memos on every tab switch.
- `OpportunityCrudPage` and `ContentCrudPage` now read `source` from a `useState` initializer instead of calling the resolver in render — the page re-renders often (modal open, form keystroke), and the resolver hits localStorage each time.
- `Capture` and `RemindersPanel` collapse their two-pass filters into single-pass `useMemo` blocks.

Coverage:
- 491 unit/integration tests, lint, build, and route-budget checks all pass.

## 2026-05-05 - Audit cycle: stability, schema validation, and UX polish

- Removed legacy flat props (`summary`, `section`, `modals`) from `CrudPageTemplate` — only the `slots.*` API is supported. All tests updated, migration doc closed.
- Added `useOfflineQueueDrain` hook and wired it into `AppLayout` to auto-drain the offline write queue on reconnect and surface failures via shell toast.
- Consolidated `useCrudPage` dual-prop aliases — the hook now accepts a single canonical set of prop names without backwards-compat fallbacks.
- Adopted Valibot schema validation for Opportunity and Content OS form payloads, replacing inline boolean guards with typed, per-field error messages.
- Made the Dashboard "Today's Main Focus" panel collapsible by default (persistent via `localStorage`) so SystemPulse covers the first-glance need without the full panel dominating the fold.
- Updated Dashboard CSS budget in route-performance budgets to cover the new disclosure-toggle styles.
- Added 19 new unit tests: `useOfflineQueueDrain`, `opportunityPayloadSchema`, `contentPayloadSchema`, and Dashboard collapsible-panel behavior (105 test files, 491 tests total).
