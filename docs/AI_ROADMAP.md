# AI Roadmap — CodeHerWay CEO OS

> Status: strategy document. This is a plan, not a shipped feature set. It maps
> where AI fits inside CEO OS, what to build first, what to avoid, and how to do
> it without breaking the calm, trustworthy feel of the product.

CEO OS already ships one AI-assisted surface: the **Chief of Staff workspace**
(`src/pages/ChiefOfStaff.jsx`, `server/chiefOfStaffProxyCore.js`,
`shared/chiefActions.js`). It runs through a server-side proxy with token auth,
rate limiting, request timeouts, deterministic fallbacks, loading/error states,
and telemetry. That foundation is the thing this roadmap extends — deliberately,
in small steps — rather than bolting a chatbot onto the app.

---

## 1. AI Product Strategy

**Position AI as a thinking aid, never an authority.** CEO OS is a calm operating
system for a solo/early-stage founder. The user's judgment is the product. AI's
job is to reduce the friction between *scattered input* (notes, half-thoughts,
meeting residue) and *structured output* (priorities, memos, follow-ups, next
actions). It compresses busywork; it does not make decisions.

Principles:

1. **Notes in, structure out.** Every AI action takes text the user already
   wrote and returns something more organized. No open-ended chat surface, no
   "ask me anything" box.
2. **Optional and off the critical path.** The app must be fully usable with AI
   disabled. AI is an accelerator on existing flows (Chief of Staff, Weekly
   Brief, Quick Capture), never a gate.
3. **Bounded actions, not a general agent.** A small, named menu of actions
   ("Turn notes into a plan", "Summarize this week", "Find blockers", "Draft a
   follow-up"). Each one has a known input, a known output shape, and a
   deterministic fallback. The current `CHIEF_ACTIONS` map is the model.
4. **Transparent provenance.** Output is always labeled with where it came from
   (`source: "proxy"` vs `source: "fallback"`) and shown as a *draft the user
   edits and accepts*, never auto-applied. The existing `ChiefOutputPanel` /
   accept-button pattern stays the rule.
5. **Server-side keys, fail-closed.** No model key ever reaches the browser. The
   proxy refuses unauthenticated requests by default (`CHIEF_STAFF_REQUIRE_TOKEN`).
   This is already true and is non-negotiable for any new AI surface.
6. **Degrade, don't break.** Network down, rate limited, key missing, model
   timeout, malformed response — every one of these resolves to a useful local
   fallback plus a calm notice, not a spinner or a stack trace.

**Success metric:** the user says "that saved me ten minutes and I trusted what
it gave me." Not "wow, magic." Not "I don't know where this came from."

---

## 2. Best First AI Feature

**"Turn these notes into a structured plan" inside Chief of Staff — hardened and
made the headline action.**

This already exists as the `plan` action. The "first feature" work is *not* net
new capability; it is making this one action excellent and obviously trustworthy:

- Make `plan` the default, visually dominant action in the Chief of Staff panel.
- Tighten the structured output contract: priorities, opportunities, content
  items, tasks — each item editable inline before "Add to workspace".
- Every output card shows: source badge (AI draft / offline draft), the action
  that produced it, and a one-line "what we sent" disclosure.
- "Add to workspace" is per-item and reversible (writes through the existing
  repository layer with undo/archive).
- Works offline via the existing deterministic fallback, clearly labeled
  "Offline draft — generated locally from your notes."

Why this first: it's the highest-leverage founder task (scattered → plan), it
reuses infrastructure that's already production-shaped, and it forces us to nail
the editable-draft + provenance pattern that every later feature inherits.

---

## 3. Features to Avoid

Do **not** build these — they break the product's character:

- **A floating chat assistant / "AI" button in the corner.** No open conversation
  surface. It invites scope creep, hallucinated authority, and "chatbot pasted
  into the app" feel.
- **Auto-apply / auto-edit.** AI never silently changes a priority, reschedules a
  task, or rewrites a memo in place. Always a draft the user accepts.
- **Autonomous agents / multi-step "do it for me" workflows.** No background
  agent taking actions across the workspace. The user runs one bounded action at
  a time.
- **Predictive scoring dressed as fact.** "This opportunity is 87% likely to
  close" — no. Opportunity scoring stays rule-based and explainable (it's already
  on the `FINAL_ROADMAP`); AI can *suggest* a rationale draft, not a number.
- **Sentiment/"how are you feeling" coaching.** Out of scope, creepy, not what a
  CEO OS is for.
- **Always-on summarization / proactive notifications.** AI runs when the user
  asks. No "we noticed you have 3 blockers" push.
- **Sending data to the model without telling the user.** No silent enrichment,
  no "we'll use your notes to improve the model" anything.
- **Client-side API keys or a `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.** Ever.
- **Model-picker / temperature sliders in the UI.** That's not user control,
  that's exposing plumbing. Real control = enable/disable, see source, edit
  output, clear history.

---

## 4. Prompt Workflow Design

Each AI action follows the same five-stage pipeline. This mirrors and formalizes
what `chiefOfStaffProxyCore.js` already does.

```
[1] Collect      → user-authored text + chosen action key (plan|summarize|draft|actions|priorities|blockers|followup)
[2] Validate     → trim, enforce MAX_NOTES_LENGTH, reject empty; client + server agree via shared/chiefConfig
[3] Compose      → system prompt (role + bounds + output schema) + action instruction (from CHIEF_ACTIONS) + user text
[4] Call         → server proxy → model Responses API, REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, no PII beyond what the user typed
[5] Normalize    → parse to known shape (extractStructuredPayloadIfPresent), clamp item counts/lengths,
                   stamp source/fallbackReason/errorCode; on ANY failure → deterministic fallback
```

**System prompt skeleton (shared across actions):**

```
You are the Chief of Staff inside CodeHerWay CEO OS, an operating system for a
solo founder. Your only job is to reorganize the founder's own notes into the
requested structure. Rules:
- Use only information present in the notes. Do not invent facts, names, dates,
  metrics, or commitments.
- If the notes are too thin to fill a section, return that section empty rather
  than padding it.
- No hype, no "as an AI", no flattery. Plain, calm, operator language.
- Return JSON matching the provided schema. Nothing else.
```

**Per-action instruction** comes from `CHIEF_ACTIONS[key].instruction` (already
the pattern). New actions to add: `blockers` ("extract things that are blocked,
who/what they're waiting on, and the smallest unblocking move") and `followup`
("draft short follow-up messages for each open thread, founder voice, ≤120
words each").

**Output schema is fixed per action** and validated server-side before the
response leaves the proxy. The client never trusts raw model text — it runs it
through `normalizeChiefOutput` and renders only known fields.

**Token discipline:** truncate notes to `MAX_NOTES_LENGTH` (12000), cap output
items per section (`MAX_STRUCTURED_ITEMS_PER_SECTION = 12`) and per-item text
(`MAX_STRUCTURED_TEXT_LENGTH = 280`) — all already enforced; keep enforcing.

---

## 5. Suggested Output Types

All outputs are **editable drafts** rendered in `ChiefOutputPanel`-style cards,
each with a source badge and per-item accept:

| Output type | Action | Shape | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Structured plan** | `plan` | priorities[], opportunities[], contentItems[], tasks[] | Focus Home / Weekly Brief / Opportunities / Content via repository writes |
| **Executive summary** | `summarize` | 3 short paragraphs: context, updates, risks | Copy out / attach to weekly review |
| **Weekly priorities** | `priorities` | ≤3 ranked items with rationale | Weekly Brief top-3 cap |
| **Blocker list** | `blockers` | items[] { what, waitingOn, smallestNextMove } | Tasks / flagged on Focus Home |
| **Follow-up drafts** | `followup` | messages[] { thread, draft (≤120w) } | Copy to clipboard; never auto-sent |
| **Founder memo** | `draft` (extended) | { title, audience, body (markdown) } | Content workspace as a draft item |
| **Next actions** | `actions` | items[] { owner, outcome, due } | Tasks |

Non-goals for output: no charts, no scores, no calendars, no "AI confidence"
meters. Text and lists, clearly labeled, editable.

---

## 6. Trust and Privacy Considerations

What the user must always be able to see and control:

- **A clear on/off.** Settings → "AI assistance" toggle. Off = the Chief of
  Staff panel shows only manual tools and the offline draft generator; no
  network calls to the proxy.
- **What gets sent, before it's sent.** A short, plain disclosure near the action
  button: *"This sends the notes you typed above to our AI provider to generate a
  draft. Nothing else from your workspace is included."* Plus a "what we send"
  expandable showing the exact payload.
- **Where the output came from.** Every card: `AI draft` vs `Offline draft
  (generated on your device)`. Already implemented via `source` / `fallbackReason`
  — keep it visible, not buried.
- **Retention answer.** A one-paragraph statement in Settings and docs:
  - Notes live in the user's workspace storage (browser/Supabase) as they do
    today.
  - When AI assistance is used, the typed text is sent to the model provider for
    that single request and is **not** stored by CEO OS as training data.
  - AI outputs are saved only when the user clicks "Add to workspace".
  - Operational telemetry (latency, error codes, action name) is recorded for
    reliability — **never** note content. (This matches the existing app-error
    telemetry design, which is content-free.)
- **No surprise persistence.** AI drafts that aren't accepted are ephemeral
  (session-only). Don't quietly write them to storage.
- **Boundedness made visible.** The action menu *is* the boundary. There is no
  free-text "ask anything" — the user can see the full list of what AI can do.
- **Fail-closed on the server.** `CHIEF_STAFF_REQUIRE_TOKEN` defaults to on;
  rate limit defaults to 10/min/client; 10s request timeout. Document these in
  `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (already partly there).
- **Honest copy.** No "your AI Chief of Staff". It's "AI-assisted drafting".
  No "magic", no "instantly understands". The `phase 2: trust copy` commit set
  the tone — hold that line.

---

## 7. Frontend Architecture Plan

Build on the existing `src/components/chief/*` + `src/hooks/useChiefOfStaff.js`
structure. No new framework, no global AI context.

```
src/
  features/ai/                    # new home for AI-shared pieces (or keep under components/chief)
    aiActions.js                  # client mirror of action keys + labels + descriptions
    useAiAction.js                # generalization of useChiefOfStaff: {run, isLoading, result, error, source, reset}
    AiDraftPanel.jsx              # generalization of ChiefOutputPanel: renders editable cards + source badge + accept
    AiSourceBadge.jsx             # "AI draft" / "Offline draft" pill
    AiDisclosure.jsx              # "what we send" expandable + privacy line
    AiOfflineFallback.js          # client-side deterministic generators (mirror of shared fallbacks)
  hooks/
    useAiEnabled.js               # reads the Settings toggle; gates network calls
  lib/
    normalizeAiOutput.js          # extends normalizeChiefOutput; one normalizer per output schema
```

Rules:

- **One hook, one action, one panel.** A page (Chief of Staff, Weekly Brief)
  imports `useAiAction("plan")`, renders an `AiDraftPanel`. No cross-page state.
- **Always render four states explicitly:** idle (with disclosure + button),
  loading (calm skeleton — reuse `OutputLoadingState`), result (editable cards),
  error/fallback (notice + offline draft). These already exist for Chief; make
  them the contract for every AI surface.
- **AI disabled = component still renders**, minus the network button: offline
  draft generator + "AI assistance is off — turn it on in Settings".
- **Accept is per-item and goes through the repository layer**, so undo/archive
  and autosave status work exactly as for manual edits.
- **Lazy-load** the heavier AI panels (the codebase already lazy-loads the
  telemetry diagnostics panel — same pattern).
- **No raw model text in the DOM.** Render only fields that survived
  normalization.
- **Telemetry on the client stays content-free** (action name, source, latency,
  error code) — reuse `app-error-telemetry`.

---

## 8. Backend / API Integration Plan

Generalize `server/chiefOfStaffProxyCore.js` into a small AI proxy that all
actions share. Do **not** spread model calls across the app.

- **Single endpoint** `/api/chief-of-staff` (keep the name for now; or
  `/api/ai-action`) → `handleAiProxy({ method, body, headers })`.
- **Request contract:** `{ action: <known key>, notes: <string ≤ MAX_NOTES_LENGTH>, correlationId? }`.
  Reject unknown actions (the allow-list already exists), reject oversized notes,
  reject empty.
- **Auth:** Bearer token / `X-Chief-Staff-Token`, fail-closed via
  `CHIEF_STAFF_REQUIRE_TOKEN`. Per-client rate limit
  (`CHIEF_STAFF_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, default 10).
- **Model call:** OpenAI Responses API (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`,
  default `gpt-4.1-mini`), `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000`, abort on timeout.
- **Response normalization server-side:** parse to the action's schema, clamp
  counts/lengths, strip anything unexpected, stamp `source`, `fallbackReason`,
  `errorCode`, `correlationId`. The browser receives only the normalized object.
- **Deterministic fallback in the proxy** for every action (extend
  `CHIEF_ACTIONS[key].fallback`): if the key is missing, the call fails, times
  out, or returns garbage → return the local fallback with
  `source: "fallback"` and a human `fallbackReason`.
- **Environment handling is a precondition, not a feature:** if `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  is unset, the proxy must return a clean `{ source: "fallback", fallbackReason:
  "AI provider not configured" }` — never 500, never leak which var is missing
  (the `phase 1: trust copy` commit already removed an env-var leak; keep it
  that way).
- **Observability:** structured logs with `requestId` + `correlationId` +
  `action` + outcome + latency. No note content in logs. Reuse the existing
  `appErrorTelemetryIngest` path for client-visible error reporting.
- **Provider abstraction (light):** a thin `callModel({ system, instruction,
  input })` so swapping `gpt-4.1-mini` for another model is a one-file change. No
  heavyweight SDK layer.

**Hard gate before any of this calls a paid API in production:** env-var
handling ✅ (exists), error states ✅ (exist), loading states ✅ (exist), privacy
copy ⬜ (needs the disclosure + retention paragraph from §6), fallback behavior
✅ (exists). Ship the privacy copy first.

## 9. Error and Fallback Strategy

Every failure mode maps to a calm, useful result. No spinners-forever, no raw
errors, no dead ends.

| Failure | What the user sees | Source | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI assistance disabled | "AI is off — turn it on in Settings" + offline draft generator | `fallback` | Toggle in Settings |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` not configured | Offline draft + "AI provider isn't set up — here's a draft generated locally" | `fallback` | (Operator config) |
| Network offline / fetch fails | Offline draft + "Couldn't reach the AI service. Here's a local draft." + Retry | `fallback` | Retry button |
| Rate limited (429) | "You've run a lot of AI actions in the last minute — here's a local draft, try again shortly." | `fallback` | Auto-clears in <60s |
| Model timeout (>10s) | Offline draft + "That took too long, so here's a local draft." + Retry | `fallback` | Retry |
| Malformed / unparseable model output | Offline draft + "The AI response wasn't usable, so here's a local draft." | `fallback` | Retry |
| Auth/token misconfig | Generic "AI service unavailable" (no detail leaked) + offline draft | `fallback` | (Operator) |
| Empty / too-short notes | Inline validation: "Add a few notes above and I'll structure them." (no call made) | n/a | User adds notes |
| Notes over `MAX_NOTES_LENGTH` | Inline: "That's a lot — I'll work from the first ~12,000 characters." | proceeds | User can trim |
| Partial success (some sections empty) | Render what came back; empty sections show "Nothing here yet — add more notes." | `proxy` | Edit / re-run |

Rules:

- **Fallbacks are real value, not placeholders.** The offline `plan` generator
  already produces a usable skeleton from the user's notes — invest there so
  "offline" still feels worth it.
- **Always tell the user the source.** A fallback that pretends to be AI output
  is the trust-killer to avoid.
- **One retry affordance**, idempotent. No auto-retry storms.
- **Errors are logged with correlation IDs**, surfaced to the user only as plain
  language. Diagnostics live behind the existing meta/telemetry panel, not in the
  main flow.

## 10. Phase-Based AI Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Trust & boundaries (prereq, do this first)
- Add the AI on/off toggle in Settings (`useAiEnabled`).
- Add the "what we send" disclosure + the privacy/retention paragraph (§6).
- Audit copy: remove any "your AI Chief of Staff" / magic phrasing; standardize
  source badges.
- Document proxy config & guarantees in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.
- **Exit criteria:** every box in the §8 hard gate is checked. *Only then* is a
  paid model call appropriate in production.

### Phase 1 — Best first feature: hardened "notes → structured plan"
- Make `plan` the dominant Chief of Staff action; per-item editable + accept via
  repository layer; offline fallback clearly labeled.
- Generalize `useChiefOfStaff` → `useAiAction`, `ChiefOutputPanel` →
  `AiDraftPanel`.
- Tests: validation, normalization, fallback paths, accept-to-workspace, AI-off
  rendering.
- **Exit criteria:** plan action is reliable, fully degradable, and every output
  shows provenance.

### Phase 2 — Adjacent bounded actions
- Add `summarize` (weekly), `priorities` (top-3), `blockers`, `followup` using
  the same pipeline + schemas + fallbacks.
- Surface `summarize`/`priorities` inside Weekly Brief; `blockers` on Focus Home;
  `followup` near Opportunities.
- **Exit criteria:** ≥4 actions live, all sharing one proxy, one panel, one
  error model.

### Phase 3 — Founder memo drafting
- Extend `draft` into `{ title, audience, body }`; lands in the Content
  workspace as an editable draft item.
- Optional: small set of memo "shapes" (investor update, team update, decision
  memo) — fixed templates, not freeform.
- **Exit criteria:** a founder can go from notes → editable memo draft → saved
  content item without leaving the calm flow.

### Phase 4 — Linking & light suggestion (only if it stays explainable)
- AI suggests *connections* the user confirms: "these 3 notes look related to the
  X opportunity — link them?" Suggestion, never automatic.
- Draft rationales for the existing rule-based opportunity scoring (text, not
  numbers).
- **Exit criteria:** no AI output is auto-applied; every suggestion is a
  one-click accept the user can ignore.

### Explicitly not on the roadmap
Chat UI, autonomous agents, predictive scores presented as fact, proactive
notifications, sentiment coaching, client-side keys, model/temperature sliders.

## 11. Codex-Ready Implementation Prompt — "Safe First AI-Ready Version"

> Paste this to an implementation agent (Codex / Claude Code). It builds **Phase
> 0 + the framing for Phase 1** — i.e. it makes the app *AI-ready and trustworthy*
> without turning on any new paid model calls. The existing Chief of Staff proxy
> stays as-is; this work wraps it in user control, disclosure, and clean
> fallbacks.

```
TASK: Make CodeHerWay CEO OS "AI-ready" — add user-facing controls, disclosure,
and consistent fallback behavior around the existing Chief of Staff AI proxy.
Do NOT add new model providers, new paid API calls, or any client-side API key.
Do NOT add a chat UI.

CONTEXT YOU MUST RESPECT:
- Existing AI surface: src/pages/ChiefOfStaff.jsx, src/hooks/useChiefOfStaff.js,
  src/components/chief/*, server/chiefOfStaffProxyCore.js, api/chief-of-staff.js,
  shared/chiefActions.js, shared/chiefConfig.js, shared/chiefStructuredPayload.js.
- The proxy already does: token auth (fail-closed via CHIEF_STAFF_REQUIRE_TOKEN),
  per-client rate limiting, 10s timeout, deterministic fallbacks, source stamping
  (source / fallbackReason / errorCode). Keep all of that.
- The app must remain fully usable with AI disabled.

DELIVERABLES:

1. AI enable/disable control
   - Add an "AI assistance" setting (default: ON) persisted via the existing
     workspace settings/repository layer. Add src/hooks/useAiEnabled.js.
   - When OFF: useChiefOfStaff (or its caller) must NOT call the proxy. The Chief
     of Staff page renders the offline/deterministic draft generator only, with a
     calm notice: "AI assistance is off. Turn it on in Settings to generate AI
     drafts." Include a link/route to Settings.

2. "What we send" disclosure + privacy copy
   - New component src/components/chief/AiDisclosure.jsx (or features/ai/):
     - Always-visible line near the action button:
       "This sends the notes you typed above to our AI provider to generate a
        draft. Nothing else from your workspace is included."
     - Expandable "See what we send" showing the exact request payload
       ({ action, notes }) — read-only, monospace.
   - Add a short retention/privacy paragraph to Settings AND to
     docs/CONFIGURATION.md, stating: typed notes are sent per-request to the
     model provider and not stored by CEO OS as training data; AI outputs are
     saved only when the user clicks "Add to workspace"; telemetry records
     latency/error-code/action name but never note content.

3. Source/provenance on every output card
   - Audit ChiefOutputPanel + its child cards: every rendered AI output must show
     a visible badge — "AI draft" when source === "proxy", "Offline draft
     (generated locally)" when source === "fallback" — plus a human-readable
     fallbackReason when present. Add src/components/chief/AiSourceBadge.jsx if a
     reusable pill doesn't already exist; reuse SourceStatusNotice where it fits.

4. Consistent four-state rendering
   - Ensure the Chief of Staff flow renders exactly: idle (disclosure + action
     buttons), loading (reuse OutputLoadingState — calm skeleton, no raw
     spinner), result (editable cards), error/fallback (notice + offline draft +
     one Retry button). Map every failure in this list to a calm message and a
     fallback result (no thrown errors, no infinite spinner):
       AI disabled • OPENAI_API_KEY unset • network/fetch failure • 429 rate
       limit • model timeout • malformed model output • auth misconfig •
       empty notes (inline validation, no call) • notes over MAX_NOTES_LENGTH
       (proceed on first ~12000 chars with an inline note).
   - The OPENAI_API_KEY-unset path must already (or must now) return
     { source: "fallback", fallbackReason: "AI provider not configured" } from
     the proxy — never a 500, never naming the missing variable. Verify and fix
     in server/chiefOfStaffProxyCore.js if needed.

5. Copy audit
   - Remove any phrasing implying autonomy or magic ("your AI Chief of Staff",
     "instantly understands", "automatically"). Standardize on "AI-assisted
     drafting". AI output is always presented as a draft the user edits and
     accepts.

6. Tests (Vitest + existing patterns)
   - useAiEnabled: ON/OFF behavior; OFF prevents proxy calls.
   - AiDisclosure: renders the static line; expandable shows the { action, notes }
     payload and nothing else.
   - ChiefOfStaff page: renders all four states; AI-OFF state hides the network
     action and shows the Settings link; fallback results show the offline badge
     + reason.
   - Proxy: OPENAI_API_KEY-unset returns a fallback (not 500) and does not leak
     the variable name.
   - Do not break existing tests in api/, server/, shared/, src/components/chief/.

7. Docs
   - Update docs/CONFIGURATION.md with the AI toggle, the privacy/retention
     paragraph, and the proxy guarantees (token fail-closed, rate limit default
     10/min, 10s timeout, fallback-on-failure).
   - Add a short "AI assistance" section to README.md pointing at this roadmap
     (docs/AI_ROADMAP.md) and stating that AI is optional, bounded, and
     server-proxied.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No new dependencies unless strictly required; if you add one, justify it in the
  PR description.
- No client-side secrets; no VITE_*_API_KEY.
- Keep components small, lazy-load heavy panels (match the existing
  ChiefTelemetryDiagnosticsPanel lazy-import pattern).
- Render only normalized fields in the DOM — never raw model text.
- Conventional, descriptive commits. Open a PR as ready for review with a summary
  + test plan.

OUT OF SCOPE (do not do): new AI actions, new model providers, chat UI,
auto-apply of AI output, agents, predictive scoring, proactive notifications.
```

### Appendix — current-state checklist (what already exists vs. what Phase 0 adds)

| Requirement before paid API calls | Status |
|---|---|
| Server-side env var handling (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, proxy) | ✅ exists |
| Fail-closed auth + rate limiting + request timeout | ✅ exists |
| Loading states | ✅ exists (`OutputLoadingState`) |
| Error states | ✅ exists (`PanelErrorFallback`, `loadError`) |
| Deterministic fallback behavior | ✅ exists (`CHIEF_ACTIONS[*].fallback`) |
| Source/provenance stamping | ✅ exists (`source`, `fallbackReason`, `errorCode`) |
| Content-free telemetry | ✅ exists (`app-error-telemetry`) |
| User-facing AI on/off control | ⬜ Phase 0 |
| "What we send" disclosure | ⬜ Phase 0 |
| Privacy/retention copy | ⬜ Phase 0 |
| Copy audit for magic/autonomy phrasing | ⬜ Phase 0 (partly done) |

When the ⬜ items are done, paid model calls are appropriate to enable in
production. Until then, the offline fallback is the safe default.
