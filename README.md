# CodeHerWay CEO OS

A calm founder operating system: focus, planning, opportunities, content, and
chief-of-staff workflows in one place. Local-first by default with a
Supabase-backed path for authenticated, account-scoped persistence.

Built in React 19 + Vite to demonstrate product-minded frontend systems work —
not just feature output. Every UX decision is filtered through one question:
*does this reduce mental load, or add to it?*

## What it is

- **Focus Home** — a command center that ranks the next smallest action across
  priorities, blockers, reminders, journal signals, opportunities, and content
  drafts. Includes ADHD-supportive states and an "I'm overwhelmed" reset.
- **Capture** — sticky-note workspace for fast brain-dump input, with composer
  rehydration through localStorage so a long brain-dump survives reloads.
- **Journal** — private daily prompts with debounced autosave and a
  one-next-thing prompt that can promote straight to a reminder.
- **Weekly Brief** — priorities, blockers, wins, and a close-of-week reflection
  that feeds Focus Home momentum and the next-move recommendation.
- **Opportunities** — an executive-grade relationship pipeline with optimistic
  concurrency, stale-record protection, and an offline write queue.
- **Content OS** — a publishing pipeline from idea to published: a six-stage
  lifecycle (Idea → Drafting → Editing → Ready → Scheduled → Published),
  content type, target publish date, purpose, and repurposing notes, with a
  stage filter and a "what's next" cue. Same persistence guarantees as
  Opportunities. See [`docs/audits/content-os-audit.md`](docs/audits/content-os-audit.md).
- **Chief of Staff** — paste founder notes; the proxy returns a structured
  action plan (priorities, opportunities, content, tasks). Each item is
  reviewable and accept-into-system in one click. Deterministic fallback when
  the AI is unavailable.

## Architecture highlights

What makes this stand out beyond a typical portfolio app:

- **Repository pattern across 8 domains.** Same contract for opportunities,
  content, weekly brief, settings, chief, capture, journal, and reminders:
  normalize → read/write from the active source (`local` vs `supabase`) →
  emit cross-tab events for lightweight synchronization.
- **Versioned-envelope local storage.** `src/lib/dataSchema.js` declares each
  domain's schema version; `versionedStorage` writes
  `{ schemaVersion, domain, model, data }` and rejects envelopes whose `domain`
  doesn't match the read site (the "wrong key swap" failure mode). A
  forward-compat migration registry lifts older payloads transparently.
- **Optimistic concurrency for local CRUD.** Records stamp `updatedAt` and
  reject stale saves with a typed `StaleRecordError`. `useCrudPage` surfaces
  the conflict as a friendly form message and refreshes the list under the
  open modal so closing it reveals the up-to-date row.
- **Corruption preservation, not silent loss.** When a JSON parse fails,
  `storageCorruption.js` preserves the corrupt blob under `${key}__corrupt_<ts>`
  and emits an event; a non-blocking `StorageCorruptionBanner` tells the user.
- **Offline write queue.** Recoverable Supabase failures enqueue a FIFO-trimmed
  replay batch (`offlineWriteQueue.js`) with stop-on-first-failure semantics
  and attempt counters. The topbar says **Pending sync** only when there are
  writes actually waiting to replay.
- **AI proxy with safe failure behavior.** `src/lib/openai.js` handles
  abort/timeout, normalizes tool-like and plain-text outputs, and falls back
  to a deterministic action plan labelled as such — never a blank panel.
- **A11y automation in CI.** `@axe-core/playwright` scans every primary route
  against wcag2a/wcag2aa/best-practice; serious/critical violations fail CI.
- **Performance budgets in CI.** Per-route bundle budgets plus a trend
  regression check, with a release-governed baseline refresh workflow.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the *why* behind these
calls — design trade-offs, what's intentionally out of scope, and the JS-not-TS
migration plan.

## Quickstart

```

## 5-minute product walkthrough

For portfolio demos or recruiter screenshares:

1. **Focus Home** — see the current operating step, the next smallest action,
   open loops, blockers, and reminders. Toggle support mode chips and the
   "I'm overwhelmed" reset.
2. **Capture** — add one sticky note as `idea`, then edit text/category inline.
3. **Journal** — answer one prompt; watch the debounced autosave status.
4. **Weekly Brief + Opportunities** — add one blocker or in-progress item;
   return to Focus Home and see the recommendation update.
5. **Chief of Staff** — paste notes, reload once to show local persistence,
   then generate output and accept at least one structured recommendation.

## Quality gates

Everything the CI workflow runs, available locally:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:run
npm run test:integration:telemetry
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npm run check:route-budgets
npm run check:route-budgets:trend
npm run report:route-budgets
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "!node_modules/**"
```

Operational diagnostics (scheduled CI jobs):

```bash
npm run check:telemetry-ingest:health
npm run check:telemetry-ingest:slo
npm run build:slo-trend-snapshot
npm run persist:slo-trend-snapshot
npm run transition:ops-incident-state
```

### Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main` and every PR:

- Markdown lint
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:run`
- `npm run typecheck`

The PR suite also runs route performance budget checks and Playwright smoke
tests including direct route refresh coverage for every primary route.

### Route baseline governance

- Baseline tracked in `scripts/route-performance-baseline.json`.
- Refresh is release-governed via the **Release Route Baseline Refresh**
  workflow (runs `update:route-budgets:baseline:release`).
- PR CI enforces static budgets + trend regression; publishes a
  `route-size-report` artifact.
- When `SUPABASE_TEST_URL` and `SUPABASE_TEST_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are present,
  CI also runs durable telemetry ingest integration tests.
- The **Scheduled Ops Alerts** workflow runs daily, checks route-size trend
  regressions plus telemetry ingest failure-rate and endpoint SLO health
  (p95 + non-2xx rate), persists snapshot rows into `ops_slo_snapshots`,
  records `open`/`acknowledged`/`recovered` transitions in
  `ops_incident_lifecycle_events`, opens or updates a tracked GitHub issue
  when thresholds are breached, and fans out to Slack/PagerDuty when
  configured.

### Branch protection automation

```bash
npm run configure:branch-protection:dry -- --repo owner/repo --branch main
```

Apply from GitHub Actions: run the **Enforce Branch Protection** workflow and
keep the required check set to `Unit + E2E`.

## Honest current boundaries

This is a local-first founder-OS prototype with production-minded architecture.
It is **not** a finished SaaS. The honest framing:

- Authentication and multi-user account UX are not yet a complete product
  experience. The magic-link surface and Supabase wiring exist; the
  account-recovery / multi-device / local-to-cloud-migration UX still needs
  product hardening.
- Supabase persistence is an upgrade path, but several local-first workflows
  still need an end-to-end authenticated regression pass against a real
  Supabase environment.
- Chief of Staff AI generation depends on deployed server secrets and proxy
  configuration. Without those, the app should be presented through its
  deterministic fallback and structured-review flow.
- Local backup import does not migrate data into Supabase.
- Operational telemetry and route-budget tooling demonstrate production
  thinking, but alert response workflows are still portfolio evidence rather
  than a fully staffed production process.

See [docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](./docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the
recruiter-facing limitation list and
[docs/PRODUCTION_TRUST_CHECKLIST.md](./docs/PRODUCTION_TRUST_CHECKLIST.md)
for the account/sync work that still separates this from a production SaaS.

## Roadmap

- Broaden integration coverage for cross-domain synchronization under
  concurrent updates.
- Add structured telemetry for AI fallback rates and acceptance outcomes.
- Expand acceptance criteria snapshots for AI-generated structured outputs.
- Migrate `src/lib/` (repositories, schemas, offline queue) to TypeScript
  with `strict: true` (planned staged migration; see ARCHITECTURE.md).

See [docs/FINAL_ROADMAP.md](./docs/FINAL_ROADMAP.md) for the phased path from
stabilization to a calmer guided operating system.

## Tracked migrations

- [MIG-CRUD-TEMPLATE-SLOTS-2026-09-30](./docs/tracking/CRUD_TEMPLATE_SLOTS_MIGRATION_2026-09-30.md):
  remove deprecated `CrudPageTemplate` legacy props (`summary`, `section`,
  `modals`) after migration to `slots.*`. **Closed.**
